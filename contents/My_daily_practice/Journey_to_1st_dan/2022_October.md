1. Keep moving the fulcrum of the joint.

1. When taking Mae Ukemi, round your body with the image of a ball in front of your chest.

2. At the moment of throwing an opponent with Tenchi Nage, swing down the raised arm with the image of lightly touching the nape of the opponent’s neck. The important thing is to eliminate the consciousness of trying to throw the opponent; you can break the opponent’s posture by swinging your arm down without effort, aiming at the nape of his neck in the movement of Tenchi Nage.

1. When doing Nikkyo, Sanko and Yonkkyo, tori’s wrists are kept in dorsiflexion and the uke’s wrist joint is locked.

2. By taking away uke’s joint degrees of freedom, tori can manipulate uke’s posture. Locking the joints is a means of moving the opponent.

1. When stepping forword, use the muscles around the forefoot hip joint to catch the momentum.

2. Your own hands lead the movement of your own body.

3. When swinging up the arm that has been grabbed, do not bend the elbow in a fixed position. Rather, swing the arm up in a circular motion with the elbow.

Hello everyone.This is Shiteiworld.

Today, I practice Aikido as usual. I practiced being careful to be aware of using the hip joints. In particular, I felt that I needed to pay attention to my hip joints when landing on my feet, when landing on my forefeet. Then, with a straight line from the back foot to the head and the hip joint of the front foot relaxed, you have a good posture.

My instructor said, “Hand movement is the flow of Ki.” What does that mean? I suspect that the instructor was trying to say the following.

The upper arms and hands are the navigators and the lower body and trunk are the engine; it is important to use the Ki navigators well in order to move with the flow of Ki.

Also, when you are grabbed by the arm, do not be aware of the area being grabbed.The important thing is to transmit power to the opponent while your body keeps moving. Be gentle at the point of contact and be careful that uke does not create resistance.

1. Smoothly absorb the attacker’s flow of force into your movement.

2. When an opponent grips your arm tightly, relax your upper arm and use your whole body to deal with the situation.

3. Against a curvilinear attack, use a curvilinear movements.

I made a mistake in today’s practice and learned from it.

The mistake was when my opponent grabbed my arm and I tried to use my upper arm muscles to break free, but I was unable to shake off the arm held by the opponent. I think the appropriate moment to do a technique is just before the opponent grabs your arm. I strongly felt the following.

Distance and timing are important for a smaller person to win against a larger person.

It takes ingenuity for a person of small stature to win against a person of large stature. And that skills are found in the teachings of Aikido.

Isn’t this very interesting?

1. When being attacked by an opponent, the most important thing is that you are not in the orbit of the attacking hand.

2. The force can be passed off by turning in the direction in which the opponent’s body is moving.

3. Create a spiral force flow with your midline as its axis. Into that spiral (like a typhoon), the opponent is engulfed.

The important thing is to be able to make the same move with or without an opponent. First, complete your own moves assuming your opponent is there. Next, practice the techniques with a “cooperative” opponent who can guide you through the ideal moves. It takes time to be able to do techniques with an opponent who is not cooperative. Practice steadily and repeatedly.

Another key point is to move in a “spiral” motion.
The spiral movement is a combination of up-and-down extension and contraction of the spine and rotation around the midline.
Let us think of the Tenchi-nage as an example.  
Many beginners who have learned the movement of the technique try to knock down their opponents by pushing forward (like a wrestling lariat). However, this does not enable a person of small stature to apply the technique to a person of large stature.  
Those who want to learn Aikido need to aim for movements that do not depend on muscle strength.
