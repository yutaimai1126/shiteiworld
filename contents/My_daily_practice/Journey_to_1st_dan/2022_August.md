1. Expand the thorax when swinging the arms up.  
It’s important that the scapular move smoothly. And, the thorax help the scapular to move (1).  
In addition, especially for upper limb elevation of 120° or more, a thorax extension motion works in conjunction with a scapular’s main movement (2).    
The decrease in the shoulder flexion angle may be explained by a reduced scapular posterior tilt due to thoracic motion restriction(OKAMUNE et al. 2020)(3).  
If you make your sord swinging grow up, you should be careful of move of your thorax.

2. Be careful not to lean forward.  
If you lean forward when you throw an opponent, you can’t keep body centered.  
Keeping the body centered is very important to move freely.

3. Keep the pelvis and trunk moving.

4. Increase the movement of the shoulder blades when poking with the jo.

5. Use the knee of the front foot smoothly.
