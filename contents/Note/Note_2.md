# I wanna prove Aikido is rational

I practice Aikido to learn how to use my body rationally. Aikido makes maximum use of external forces such as gravity and inertia to neutralize the opponent’s force with minimal exertion of muscular power. It also allows one to unify oneself from head to toe through self-control such as tanden awareness. These physical manipulations are of great use in actual fighting. And it has been proven by [Tetsuya Yamato](https://www.k-1.co.jp/fighter/318/)

Tetsuya Yamato, the winner of this kickboxing title match, incorporates aikido into his physical manipulation and mental conditioning.

Tetsuya Yamato says this in an interview in the following video.

Aikido won’t make you a kickboxing champion, but the mental control of aikido is useful. The combination of the combat skills developed in kickboxing and the mentality of aikido creates a good synergy.

The essence of Aikido is not in the techniques that can be seen from the outside, but in the sense of connection between oneself and one’s opponent and one’s own physical sensations. I practice Aikido with the motivation to acquire that sense and improve my own physical manipulation ability.
