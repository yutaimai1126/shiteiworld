# Tips for relaxing muscles in Aikido

In Aikido, it is very important to relax the muscles properly.
My teacher used to say to me:

“Relax. If your muscles are tense, you will not be able to perform the techniques.”

However, it is not easy to get rid of bad habits in the body. Even if you imagine smooth movements like a ballerina, the actual movements are often as awkward as a robot’s.
I am currently a “2-kyu” certified Aikikai. I have been learning Aikido for about two years now, and I am struggling to acquire smooth movements.

Therefore, for the sake of improving my own techniques, and for those who, like me, struggle to master smooth movements, I would like to use this blog to elucidate Aikido techniques from a scientific perspective and provide “tips” on how to improve them.

In the next few chapters, I will summarize some tips for relaxing the muscles in Aikido.

So if you’re an aikido practitioner, or just interested in studying how to use your body, be sure to check out this blog!
