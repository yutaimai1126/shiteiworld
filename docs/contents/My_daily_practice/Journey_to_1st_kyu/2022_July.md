3. In “katate-dori” and “ryoute-dori,” the uke does not grip the arm of the tori as hard as possible, but rather “connects” the bottom of the palm with the tori’s arm.

4. When doing “irimi-nage”, the shoulder blades should be relaxed in line with the uke strike.

5. When doing “Ikkyo”, the moment the uke swings his knife hand and strikes, tori takes the initiative and strikes his knife hand toward the midline of the uke.  This causes uke to raise his elbow. Then, tori drops uke’s elbow in a circular motion toward uke’s midline.

1. When handling “ryoute-dori”, use the centrifugal force generated by “irimi-tenkan” to cut off the hand held by uke drawing a circle, as if throwing out the arm.

2. When taking a step forward, swap the halves so that the left and right pelvic bones rub together.

3. When doing irimi, push the body forward by pushing the ground with the back leg. At that time, relax the front leg and use the force of the body falling forward.

4. The moment uke grabs tori’s arm, tori relaxes and accepts uke’s power.

5. When tori applies a technique, the arms are swung up and down in own midline.

1. When doing “shihou-nage”, extend your body and raise your arms as if you were taking a deep breath.

2. When doing “morote-dori-kokyu-nage”, first bring the arm held by uke to your midline while lowering your shoulder blades. At the same time, move behind uke, extend your spine, and raise your arms.  At that time, if you turn yourself in the direction that uke is facing, it will be easier for uke to break his posture.  Finally, swing your arms down as you turn toward uke’s midline.

3. Always keep your center of gravity on your midline.

2. When doing “1-kyo-osae(suppression technique)”, keep the shoulder and elbow of uke from floating.

3. When swinging down with a knife hand, do not shrug the shoulders and use the trunk muscles.

4. Move the trunk muscles first before the arms and legs.

2. When uke grabs your forearm, use your whole body to manipulate the entire forearm. It is important to think of the forearm as a wooden stick or something else, without placing your attention on the forearm that is grabbed.

1. If you keep pointing your index finger at uke’s throat between moves, you can smoothly move on to the next move.

2. Perform the technique by lightly stretching the fingertips while relaxing them.

3. When you swing your arms up, use your body as if you were swinging a Japanese sword.
